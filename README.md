# TradingView MCP Bridge

Personal AI assistant for your TradingView Desktop charts. Connects Claude Code to your local TradingView app via Chrome DevTools Protocol for AI-assisted chart analysis, Pine Script development, and workflow automation.

> **For personal use only.** See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) for important information about TradingView's Terms of Service.

## What It Does

Gives your AI assistant eyes and hands on your own chart:

- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read your chart's indicator values, price levels, and annotations
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal lines, rectangles, text annotations
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, and delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries/exits
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state for AI visual analysis
- **Launch TradingView** — auto-detect and launch with debug mode from any platform

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thedailyprofiler/tradingview-mcp.git
cd tradingview-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView Desktop must be running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled on port 9222.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh
```

**Or launch manually on any platform:**
```bash
/path/to/TradingView --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**Or use the MCP tool** (auto-detects your install):
> "Use tv_launch to start TradingView in debug mode"

### 3. Add to Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/.mcp.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/tradingview-mcp` with your actual path.

### 4. Verify

Ask Claude: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected"*

## Finding TradingView on Your System

The launch scripts and `tv_launch` tool auto-detect TradingView's install location. If auto-detection fails:

| Platform | Common Locations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Mac** | `/Applications/TradingView.app/Contents/MacOS/TradingView` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TradingView\TradingView.exe`, `%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps\TradingView*\TradingView.exe` |
| **Linux** | `/opt/TradingView/tradingview`, `~/.local/share/TradingView/TradingView`, `/snap/tradingview/current/tradingview` |

The key flag is `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. This enables Chrome DevTools Protocol which the MCP server connects to.

## Reading Pine Script Indicator Output

The `data_get_pine_*` tools let your AI assistant read what's visually displayed on your chart by your own Pine Script indicators — the same information you see with your eyes.

This includes levels drawn with `line.new()`, text from `label.new()`, session tables from `table.new()`, and zones from `box.new()`. This enables AI-assisted analysis of your custom indicator output.

**Requirements:**
- The indicator must be **visible** on your chart
- The indicator uses Pine's drawing functions (`line.new()`, `label.new()`, `box.new()`, `table.new()`)

**Example prompts:**
```
"What levels is my profiler showing right now?"
"Read the session stats table and tell me how today compares to the 10-day median"
"What are the key support/resistance lines on my chart?"
```

## Example Workflows

### AI Chart Analysis
```
"Read my indicators, check the key levels on my chart, and give me a confluence report"
```

### Pine Script Development
```
"Write a Pine Script RSI divergence indicator, put it on the chart, and screenshot the result"
```

### Multi-Symbol Screening
```
"Compare Bollinger Band squeeze across ES, NQ, YM, and RTY on the 15-minute chart"
```

### Replay Practice
```
"Start replay on ES 5-minute from March 1st, step through 20 bars, buy at a support level"
```

## Architecture
